Hi, Iâ€™m David Ian Watson!

I'm a recent college graduate from UNH and am looking for remote work.

I have experience in all sorts of languages, but the once I have the most practical experience in are Javascript, Java, C++, and C.

In my free time, I enjoy games of discord mafia, creative writing, piano, and video games.
